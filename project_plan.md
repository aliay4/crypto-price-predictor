# Cryptocurrency Price Predictor Website - Detailed Project Plan

## 1. Project Overview
This project aims to create a fully functional cryptocurrency price evaluation website with a focus on price prediction. The website will use the CoinGecko API for data collection and implement various technical and fundamental analysis metrics to provide users with insights into current and future cryptocurrency prices.

## 2. Technology Stack

### Backend
- **Framework**: Flask (Python)
- **Data Processing**: Pandas, NumPy
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras for price prediction models
- **API Integration**: CoinGecko API
- **Database**: SQLite for development (can be migrated to PostgreSQL for production)

### Frontend
- **Framework**: React.js
- **State Management**: Redux
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Data Visualization**: Chart.js, D3.js
- **HTTP Client**: Axios

## 3. Key Features

### Data Collection and Processing
- Real-time cryptocurrency price data from CoinGecko API
- Historical price data for analysis and prediction
- Market metadata (volume, market cap, etc.)

### Technical Analysis Indicators (in order of importance)
1. Moving Averages (Simple and Exponential)
2. Relative Strength Index (RSI)
3. MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)
4. Bollinger Bands
5. Fibonacci Retracement Levels

### Fundamental Analysis Metrics
1. Market Capitalization
2. Trading Volume
3. Supply Mechanisms (circulating supply, max supply)

### Price Prediction
- Time-series forecasting using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks
- Performance evaluation of prediction models
- Visualization of predicted price trends

### User Interface
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile
- Interactive charts and visualizations
- Cryptocurrency selection and comparison
- Dashboard with key metrics and indicators

## 5. API Integration Details

### CoinGecko API Endpoints
- `/coins/markets`: Get list of supported coins with market data
- `/coins/{id}`: Get current data for a specific coin
- `/coins/{id}/market_chart`: Get historical market data
- `/coins/{id}/ohlc`: Get OHLC data (Open, High, Low, Close)

## 6. Machine Learning Model Architecture

### LSTM Model for Price Prediction
- Input: Historical price data (last 60 days)
- Features: Price, volume, market cap, and technical indicators
- Output: Predicted prices for next 7 days
- Evaluation metrics: RMSE (Root Mean Square Error), MAE (Mean Absolute Error)

## 7. Deliverables
- Fully functional cryptocurrency price prediction website
- Source code with documentation
- Deployment instructions
- User guide
